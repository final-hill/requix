requix
	There are potentially an unlimited number of custom diagrams, charts, and graphs
	that translate into requirements
	Requix should expose the ability to define the meaning of these with some form of editor
		Ex: a means of mapping ER diagram nodes to the equivalent Requirements definition in the KB

  Smart data vs dumb code:

Assume I have: BreadCrumb( name:string, url: Url )

The requirement is that the name should not contain hyphens. (They should be spaces instead)
Should the sanitation be done by the client of the object? I'd say no as this logic is duplicated.
Should this be done by the setter of name? Should it throw an error?
As a requirement, how is tracability managed?

Requirements driven development vs Prolog.
Deriving implementation by constraints? Same trade-offs?
	Unlike prolog you're not searching the available space though... Or are you?


feature branching not optimal?
	feature interact
	requirements are cross cutting
	
	if two features are bein developed in an iteration and they share dependencies, coordination
	is needed. feature A has to merge with feature B or vice-verse for coordination.
	with N features this does not scale... Features need a common branch which is not master...
	release branch?
		just duplicates master if not maintaining these releases...
	
what is the basic unit of development?
	- feature?
		is it the minimum unit of an iteration and therefore not good for daily work or for sharing tasks
		can a feature be completed in an iteration? it can have multiple requirements
	- requirement?
		requirement is 1 to many relationship with features...


in planning organization don't put requirements under features?
	who has tasks? features or requirements? both?
	requirements need tests for verification

http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4667#comment-74004 

Bracha talks of Pluggable Types
 
Perhaps these Types come from the Requirements project?
    A set of propositions and such which generate types or contracts.
    The Domain of Discourse
        Aside: Contracts as a domain of discourse?
    THis then feeds into the code as a capability model.
    change the requirements => changes the types => etc.


    ==============
    User Requirement Format

	As an <actor phrase > I want <action phrase> so that <outcome phrase>

Acceptance Criteria Format
Functional/Nonfunctional/Performance/Error Handling…


======================
When requirements change, dependency on dark corners of code become an issue


================
in FOSS, the boring work doesn't get done...
The boring part could include security requirements... 


==================
Simultaneous SOWs

Different billing and delivery dates

Parallel work

Shared or interacting features or requirements

Same as SPE


=============
RFP can list requirements scenarios and use cases 

Can be used to seed requirements spec
